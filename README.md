This will help you keep organized for appointments or your work schedule. At the top it will have the current date displayed. Once you type in the appointment you press the save button and it will save it locally. If the current time is past the time block on the planner it will have a background color of grey. If it is the current time it will display red, and for future times it will be a green background.
